## [JBA-Jv] Project: SQLite Viewer

In this project I will learn to erect a GUI for viewing database contents.  I hope to gain (much needed) experience in connecting the backend (database system) with the frontend (user experience).


### Project Description
Sometimes we need a tool that shows the database contents -- tables and the data inside.  You can write an application that will allow you to look into the abyss of your database.


### Learning Outcomes
Create a SWING application and connect an SQLite database to extract the data into a JTable.
